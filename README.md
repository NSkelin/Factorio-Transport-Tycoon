# Transportorio
Transportorio is a mod for the video game Factorio that overhauls how the game is played. Transportorio is branched off of another mod called [TradeRouteOverhaul](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/TradeRouteOverhaul). 

The goal of Transportorio is the same as a vanilla Factorio game; Too launch one or more rockets. The difference lies in how you get there. In vanilla Factorio a player can place and demolish many kinds of buildings. These buildings refine basic materials such as iron and copper into more advanced materials such as circuits. Eventually you refine materials and research enough technology to craft a rocket and win the game.

In Transportorio, instead of placing buildings and choosing what they make, you instead must find "cities". Cities are collections of buildings with pre-chosen recipes. You cannot build, demolish, or change these buildings recipes. Instead you must trade resources from building to building, city to city, eventually working your way up through the trade tiers until you can again launch rockets.
